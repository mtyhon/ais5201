abstract="Semantic multimedia organization is an open challenge. In this chapter, we present an innovative way of automatically organizing multimedia information to facilitate content-based browsing. It is based on self-organizing maps. The visualization capabilities of the self-organizing map provide an intuitive way of representing the distribution of data as well as the object similarities. The main idea is to visualize similar documents spatially close to each other, while the distance between different documents is bigger. We demonstrate this on the particular case of video information. One key concept is the disregard of the temporal aspect during the clustering. We introduce a novel time bar visualization that reprojects the temporal information. The combination of innovative visualization and interaction methods allows efficient exploration of relevant information in multimedia content.",

abstract="The last guidelines approved by Italian government to financially support the solar Photovoltaic (PV) Energy production development (Fourth and Fifth feed-in-scheme, January 2012 and later), in order to avoid soil consumption in agricultural or naturals areas, include specific indications for more advantageously funding installations exploiting roofs or covers surfaces. In this context it becomes important, for a suitable PV planning and monitoring, the extensive mapping of the available surfaces extent, usually corresponding to covers and properly assessing their quality in term of PV potential. Since the covers are mainly located in urban or industrial areas, whose 3D heterogeneity, albedo, atmospheric turbidity and casting shadows significantly influence the local solar irradiance, it is necessary to suitably account for these distributed factors by means of GIS mapping and advanced modeling tools in order to provide realistic estimates of solar available radiance at roofs level. The implemented methodology, based on remote sensing techniques, has allowed to estimate and map the global solar radiance over all the roofs within Avellino (southern Italy) municipality. Starting from LIDAR data, DSM of the entire area of interest ({\textasciitilde}42 Km2) has been firstly obtained; then the 3D model of each building and related cover has been derived. To account the atmospheric transparency and the related time-dependent diffuse/direct radiation percentage on the area, data and tools from EU PVGIS web application have been also used. The final processing to obtain the solar radiance maps has been carried out using specific software modules available within commercial and open-source GIS packages.",
